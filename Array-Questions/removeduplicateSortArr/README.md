## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

You must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, and the first two elements of nums should be 1 and 2.


Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,,,,,_]
