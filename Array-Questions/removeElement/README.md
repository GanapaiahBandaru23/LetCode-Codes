## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` **in-place** such that the relative order of the elements may be changed.

Return the number of elements in `nums` which are **not equal** to `val`.  
You must do this by modifying the input array **in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

## ðŸ’¡ Example

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,,]

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,3,0,4,,,_]
