# Reshape the Matrix (LeetCode 566)

## Problem Statement
You are given a matrix represented by a 2D array `mat`, and two integers `r` and `c` representing the number of rows and columns of the desired reshaped matrix.  
The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same **row-traversing order** as they were.

If the reshape is not possible, return the original matrix.

## Example
**Input:**
Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 1, c = 4
Output: [[1,2,3,4]]

Example 2:


Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 2, c = 4
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
